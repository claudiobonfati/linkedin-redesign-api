By offering customers more than they want - low prices, wide selection and convenience - Amazon continues to grow and evolve as a world-class e-commerce platform.<br/><br/>Founded by Jeff Bezos, the <a href='https://amazon.com' target='_blank'>Amazon.com</a> website started in 1995 as a place to buy books due to the unique customer experience that the Web could offer book lovers. Bezos believed that only the Internet could offer customers the convenience of browsing through a selection of millions of book titles in a single session. During the first 30 days of business, Amazon placed orders for customers in 50 states and 45 countries - all shipped from its garage in the Seattle area."

      body: "I recently reviewed a resume for a colleague who was trying to define a clearer career strategy. She has terrific experience. And yet, as I looked through it I could see the problem she was concerned about: she had done so many good things in so many different fields it was hard to know what was distinctive about her. <br/><br/> As we talked it became clear the resume was only the symptom of a deeper issue. In an attempt to be useful and adaptable she has said yes to too many good projects and opportunities. She has ended up feeling overworked and underutilized. It is easy to see how people end up in her situation:",

Plus, consistent productivity has the wonderful byproduct of accomplishing more.

Yes, there are days when I don’t get them all done, but I do my best to deliver. It has proven very effective for me. They are:<br/><b>1</b> Read something related to my industry.<br/><b>2</b> Read something related to business development.<br/><b>3</b> Send two emails to touch base with old colleagues.<br/><b>4</b> Empty my private client inbox by responding to all career coaching questions within one business day.",

      body: "Success comes in all shapes and colours. You can be successful in your job and career but you can equally be successful in your marriage, at sports or a hobby. Whatever success you are after there is one thing all radically successful people have in common: Their ferocious drive and hunger for success makes them never give up. <br/><br/>Successful people (or the people talking or writing about them) often paint a picture of the perfect ascent to success. In fact, some of the most successful people in business, entertainment and sport have failed. Many have failed numerous times but they have never given up. Successful people are able to pick themselves up, dust themselves off and carry on trying.<br/><br/>I have collected some examples that should be an inspiration to anyone who aspires to be successful. They show that if you want to succeed you should expect failure along the way.",

      body: "My last post, How Successful People Stay Calm, really struck a nerve (it's already approaching 1.5 million reads here on LinkedIn). The trick is that managing your emotions is as much about what you won’t do as it is about what you will do. <br/><br/>TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90% of top performers, to be exact). So, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people are careful to avoid in order to keep themselves calm, content, and in control. They consciously avoid these behaviors because they are tempting and easy to fall into if one isn’t careful.<br/><br/>While the list that follows isn’t exhaustive, it presents nine key things that you can avoid in order to increase your emotional intelligence and performance.",

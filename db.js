Yes, there are days when I don’t get them all done, but I do my best to deliver. It has proven very effective for me.

Whatever success you are after there is one thing all radically successful people have in common: Their ferocious drive and hunger for success makes them never give up. <br/><br/>Successful people (or the people talking or writing about them) often paint a picture of the perfect ascent to success. In fact, some of the most successful people in business, entertainment and sport have failed. Many have failed numerous times but they have never given up. Successful people are able to pick themselves up, dust themselves off and carry on trying.<br/><br/>I have collected some examples that should be an inspiration to anyone who aspires to be successful. They show that if you want to succeed you should expect failure along the way.",

The trick is that managing your emotions is as much about what you won’t do as it is about what you will do. <br/><br/>TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90% of top performers, to be exact). So, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people are careful to avoid in order to keep themselves calm, content, and in control. They consciously avoid these behaviors because they are tempting and easy to fall into if one isn’t careful.<br/><br/>While the list that follows isn’t exhaustive, it presents nine key things that you can avoid in order to increase your emotional intelligence and performance.",
